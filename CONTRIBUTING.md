# Contributing

1. Fork it (https://github.com/jerometwell/pynonymizer/fork)
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')
4. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
5. Create a new Pull Request

At this point you're waiting on the maintainers. They might suggest an improvement or provide feedback.

Once everyone's happy the request will be merged.

## Development requirements

There are a few key indicators of an acceptable contribution. 

* Format your code with `black`. A github action will automatically format incoming PRs if it's required.
* Create high-quality, useful tests for features, changes in functionality, and bug replication cases.
* Write descriptive, informative [commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* Add user-facing description of your work to an entry in the `CHANGELOG.md` file, under the `[Unreleased]` section. If you're unsure why this is important, check out [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the intended release process.

## Issues

In an ideal world, changes come with discussion, so for general points and structural changes an issue might be more productive.
Try to provide as much useful or relevant information as possible so as to improve the project for everyone.
